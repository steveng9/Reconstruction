# Dataset settings
dataset:
  name: "nist_crc"
  size: 1000  # Keep small for linear attack (memory constraints)
  type: "categorical"
  dir: "/home/golobs/data/NIST_CRC/dev_data"

QI: "QI1"  # Use predefined QI from your dataset

# Synthetic data generation
sdg_method: "synth"  # Will use synth.csv from data directory
sdg_params: {}

# Attack selection
attack_method: "LinearReconstruction"
data_type: "categorical"  # Linear attack only works on categorical (binary) features

# Attack parameters
attack_params:

  # Ensembling and chaining NOT recommended for LinearReconstruction
  # (attack is designed for single features)
  ensembling:
    enabled: false

  chaining:
    enabled: false

  # Linear Reconstruction specific parameters
  LinearReconstruction:
    k: 3  # k-way queries (default: 3)
    n_procs: 4  # Number of processors for Gurobi solver

# Notes:
# - This attack only reconstructs ONE binary feature at a time
# - hidden_features must have length 1
# - The feature must be binary (2 unique values)
# - Requires Gurobi license (academic license available)
# - Memory usage grows with dataset size - keep n < 5000 for 3-way queries
